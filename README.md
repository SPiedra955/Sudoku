# How sudoku works ?

You have to start writing numbers in every cell available in the sudoku also you have try not to repeate numbers in the same row,once you fullfill the first row,complete the second and soo on until all the rows are completed,then we have to check if the numbers aren't repeated but this time in columns.

When we check that all is correct the game is ended also try it until you success.

## Rules

* Sudoku consists of a 9 x 9 grid. Which in turn is subdivided into 9 regions of 3 x 3. In this case is 3 x 3.
* The objective is to fill the entire grid with the numbers between 1 and 9, so that each box contains only one number and each row, column and region has all the numbers without repeating. In this case some test are filled with numbers of 1 to 3 or 6 depending of the grid.
* Just a tip, when you are filling the grids,write it with a pencil and an eraser for correct mistakes.
